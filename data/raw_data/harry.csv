H          arry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For,14
"           one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any",14
"other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his home-",14

also happened to be a wizard.,14

Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved,14
"the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he",14
"looked for something that would help him write his essay, “Witch",14
Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless —,14

   The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry,14
"pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flash-",14
"light closer to the book, and read:",14

        Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in me-,15
"        dieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On",15

"        wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch",15

    Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath,15
his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and,15
"very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it,",15
"and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because",15
if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way,15

board under the stairs for the rest of the summer.,15
"    The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason",15
"that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon,",15

"toward magic. Harry’s dead parents, who had been a witch and",15
"wizard themselves, were never mentioned under the Dursleys’ roof.",15
"For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they",15
"kept Harry as downtrodden as possible, they would be able to",15

Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of,16
"Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was",16
"to lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick",16
"at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the",16
neighbors.,16
    This separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for,16
"Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of hol-",16
"iday work. One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrink-",16
"ing potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape,",16
who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention,16
for a month. Harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week,16
"of the holidays. While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley",16
had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon’s new,16
"company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street",16
"would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock",16
"on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and",16
hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn’t leave spots of ink,16
"on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying",16
magic by night.,16
    Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and,16
"uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad",16
"mood with him, all because he’d received a telephone call from a",16
fellow wizard one week into the school vacation.,16
"    Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at Hogwarts,",16
came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a,16
"lot of things Harry didn’t, but had never used a telephone before.",16
Most unluckily it had been Uncle Vernon who had answered the,16
call.,16

                    CHAPTER ONE,17
"   Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he",17
heard Ron’s voice answer.,17
   “HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT —,17
TO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!”,17
   Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held,17
"the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression",17
of mingled fury and alarm.,17
   “WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece.,17
“WHO ARE YOU?”,17
"   “RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he and",17
Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field.,17
“I’M — A — FRIEND — OF — HARRY’S — FROM —,17
SCHOOL —”,17
"   Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was",17
rooted to the spot.,17

"holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though frightened it might",17
explode. “I DON’T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE TALK-,17
ING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU,17
COME NEAR MY FAMILY!”,17
   And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if drop-,17

   The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.,17

"Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn’t been in touch either. Harry",18
"suspected that Ron had warned Hermione not to call, which was a",18
"pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s year, had",18
"Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and",18
would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to,18
Hogwarts.,18
    So Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for,18
"five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as",18
bad as the last one. There was just one very small improvement —,18
after swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to any of his,18
"friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at",18
night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig,18
made if she was locked in her cage all the time.,18
    Harry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to,18
listen again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the,18
"distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be",18
"very late, Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Per-",18
haps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. . . .,18
    He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase,18
"from under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay,",18
"quill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose",18
"floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and",18
checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.,18
    It was one o’clock in the morning. Harry’s stomach gave a funny,18
"jolt. He had been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a",18
whole hour.,18
    Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked,18
forward to his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in,18

"his life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays,",19
and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.,19
"    Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig’s large, empty",19
"cage, to the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air",19
pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig,19
had been absent for two nights now. Harry wasn’t worried about,19
her: she’d been gone this long before. But he hoped she’d be back,19
soon — she was the only living creature in this house who didn’t,19
flinch at the sight of him.,19
"    Harry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had",19
"grown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however,",19
"was just as it always had been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he",19
"did to it. The eyes behind his glasses were bright green, and on his",19
"forehead, clearly visible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped",19
like a bolt of lightning.,19
"    Of all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most ex-",19
"traordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten",19

cause Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had,19
"been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a",19

Instead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of,65

"    “Hang on,” said Harry quickly, “I’ve already got one of those.”",66
    “Have you?” A look of enormous relief spread over the manager’s,66

sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley. He caught,67

"Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood,",314
wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and,314
Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting,314

more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of,314
punishment. Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage,314

Snape’s behavior toward Harry over the past week had been quite,442

   Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped,445
